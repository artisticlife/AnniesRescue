            h3 Adoption Procedure
            p We are committed to placing pets into homes where they will be enjoyed and loved for their lifetime. We want our fosters and the people who adopt them to be happy and comfortable with each other. Our adoption process is in place to ensure that we make good matches and, though it can be difficult for us to choose one home over another or decline an adoption application, we do so with the best interest of our foster pets in mind. You will always be told if we have a concern with your application or any other part of the process. We believe in honesty and education, so you will know if there is a problem. We hope you will understand the choices we make.

            p Every applicant will start by filling out our adoption application. This form is designed to help us have a better understanding of your home and what you are looking for in a pet. In the application there is a form that will give permission for us to contact your Veterinarian. If you do not have a current Veterinarian, you may enter the name of a previous Vet you have used. We do call Vets on all applications. We feel that the best way to predict the care you will give your new pet, is to establish that you have provided care in the past. If you are new to pet ownership, this may not be the place for you to start. In all honesty, it would be difficult for us to adopt to a home with no pet experience. That is not to say you could not be a great home, but with so many homeless pets, you have other options for adoption and we are sure you will find a pet elsewhere. If you would still like to apply and can provide some references, please do so and we will do our best to accommodate you or refer you to another rescue.

            p Everyone will be contacted by phone or email and any questions about your application or your Vet check will be discussed. If we feel confident a good match has been found, we will schedule a home visit. At this time, we will bring the foster pet to your home for you to meet them. We do not do meetings with the pet prior to the application and vet check. It can be very stressful for pets to be taken to multiple meetings. And there would be many if we took them to see everyone that shows an interest. We do not put them through that unless we know you will qualify. We do not have a shelter for you to visit, so this is the way we have chosen to do meetings. You are under no obligation to adopt when you meet the pet if you do not feel it is a good match. We will check your home for any hazards or issues that may need to be resolved, but mainly, we will look at how comfortable the foster pet is there. We feel that the fosters pick their homes. When a foster is fairly calm in your home and happy to meet you, we feel like that is the home for them. If you feel the same way, then a great match has been made. In some instances you may be able to keep your new pet starting immediately. If you need time to consider, you will be given time. We will not move on to another home until we have made a decision on the first home.

            p This may seem a little much for some of you. We take responsibility for these pets for a lifetime. If, for any reason, an unforeseeable event should make it necessary to return a pet, we take them back into our rescue. We are a small rescue. Imagine if we didn‚Äôt take great care in selecting homes. We must do our best to ensure that our pets stay in their homes and are cared for to our high standards. We would not like a dog returned years later and have to pay for heartworm treatment because a home did not keep the dog on heartworm prevention. That would take a lot of resources that could be used for saving other dogs from euthanasia. Even worse, we would hate to find out one of our fosters had passed away due to negligence. We love these pets in our own home. We provide the very best Veterinary care and preventative medicine. We expect an adoptive home to do the same.

            p We also charge an adoption donation. We cannot save other pets if we cannot pay our medical bills or buy food. We rely on donations to function. We put more money into your future pet than you will pay in an adoption fee 99% of the time. Our adoption fee will depend on how much we have put into the pet medically. We do not even add up the other costs of feeding and housing the pet. Most times, you will be provided with a list of medical treatments and expenses so that you are aware of what they entail. Most adoption fees will be between $75 and $150. That number could be less or more, but it is important to us that the fee not be too extremely high.

            p If you have gotten this far, it is fair to assume that you understand our intention with finding great homes for our great pets. If this is not for you, please check with other rescues, as we all have different rules to go by. By all means, if you want a pet right away and don‚Äôt want to go through an adoption process, please go to a local shelter and adopt a pet that might not make it out if not for you.

            h3 How Do You Let Them Go?
            p I am asked the same question when people hear that I foster animals. First they say, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs so great that you can do this‚Äù and then they say, ‚Äúbut I could never do it. I would get too attached. How do you let them go?‚Äù The answer is simple and it is complicated. The truth is, I don‚Äôt have a secret for not getting attached. I don‚Äôt know of a way to make it easy. I do become attached. It takes me very little time to become attached. The first time I look into their eyes and I know that I am responsible for the life that they will have, I am attached. They are a part of me. It does hurt to let them go, but that pain is tempered by the fact that, I cannot keep them all and to help more, I HAVE to let them go.
p It is as simple as that day you say to yourself, ‚ÄúI can foster and let them go because it is for the best and it will help so many.‚Äù Instead of telling yourself, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt do that because it will hurt me too much.‚Äù
It is as complicated as that also. The changing what you tell yourself.
For years I wanted to foster pets. I made excuses for not doing it ‚Äúright now‚Äù. I don‚Äôt have time. I don‚Äôt know how to start. I have pets of my own. But, fostering choose me and I ran out of excuses. It‚Äôs not meant to be easy. It‚Äôs meant to be helpful and good. It‚Äôs meant to save lives and rehabilitate mistreated pets. It is hard, but it is necessary.
Should I have done it sooner? Maybe not. Maybe I gave the excuses until I was done and accepted fostering when Annie dug into my yard because I was ready. (See Annie‚Äôs Story) I didn‚Äôt have to foster her. Or, I could have stopped when I found her a home. But, I did foster Annie and I did go on to foster more dogs after Annie. Why? Because as much as it hurts to let them go, it felt amazing to know that I contributed to making her life better. And I can do it again and again.
I‚Äôve seen some posts where people feel bullied about NOT fostering. I don‚Äôt think it is something you should be pushed into. You need to be ready to say to yourself, ‚Äúthis is not my dog, but I will love this dog like it is mine and then I will find him a home of his own.‚Äù You need to be able to be strong and resolved to do this thing called fostering. It isn‚Äôt an easy thing. Sometimes there are hard decisions. But, if you are to the point where you think you might be giving yourself excuses when fostering is something that you truly want to do, try it once. With one pet. And if the worste thing that happens, is that you keep that one pet, oh well. That pet has a home. But, if you find that in the giving up, you gain something. Keep doing it.
I read a post once that compared fostering pets to raising children. You know one day that they will grow up and leave home. Have their own lives. And maybe when they do it hurts. But, knowing this, you have children anyway. You raise them and they move off and find their own lives. It is a bit of a different thing. Hopefully your children come home and visit from time to time üôÇ But, you know you are doing something worthwhile and that gives you a great sense of fulfillment.
That is fostering to me. I can‚Äôt keep them all. I won‚Äôt be able to save them all. But, I can make the difference in the lives of many. A big difference. And that is how I let them go.
