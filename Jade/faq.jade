p We are committed to placing pets into homes where they will be enjoyed and loved for their lifetime. We want our fosters and the people who adopt them to be happy and comfortable with each other. Our adoption process is in place to ensure that we make good matches and, though it can be difficult for us to choose one home over another or decline an adoption application, we do so with the best interest of our foster pets in mind. You will always be told if we have a concern with your application or any other part of the process. We believe in honesty and education, so you will know if there is a problem. We hope you will understand the choices we make.

p Every applicant will start by filling out our adoption application. This form is designed to help us have a better understanding of your home and what you are looking for in a pet. In the application there is a form that will give permission for us to contact your Veterinarian. If you do not have a current Veterinarian, you may enter the name of a previous Vet you have used. We do call Vets on all applications. We feel that the best way to predict the care you will give your new pet, is to establish that you have provided care in the past. If you are new to pet ownership, this may not be the place for you to start. In all honesty, it would be difficult for us to adopt to a home with no pet experience. That is not to say you could not be a great home, but with so many homeless pets, you have other options for adoption and we are sure you will find a pet elsewhere. If you would still like to apply and can provide some references, please do so and we will do our best to accommodate you or refer you to another rescue.

p Everyone will be contacted by phone or email and any questions about your application or your Vet check will be discussed. If we feel confident a good match has been found, we will schedule a home visit. At this time, we will bring the foster pet to your home for you to meet them. We do not do meetings with the pet prior to the application and vet check. It can be very stressful for pets to be taken to multiple meetings. And there would be many if we took them to see everyone that shows an interest. We do not put them through that unless we know you will qualify. We do not have a shelter for you to visit, so this is the way we have chosen to do meetings. You are under no obligation to adopt when you meet the pet if you do not feel it is a good match. We will check your home for any hazards or issues that may need to be resolved, but mainly, we will look at how comfortable the foster pet is there. We feel that the fosters pick their homes. When a foster is fairly calm in your home and happy to meet you, we feel like that is the home for them. If you feel the same way, then a great match has been made. In some instances you may be able to keep your new pet starting immediately. If you need time to consider, you will be given time. We will not move on to another home until we have made a decision on the first home.

p This may seem a little much for some of you. We take responsibility for these pets for a lifetime. If, for any reason, an unforeseeable event should make it necessary to return a pet, we take them back into our rescue. We are a small rescue. Imagine if we didn’t take great care in selecting homes. We must do our best to ensure that our pets stay in their homes and are cared for to our high standards. We would not like a dog returned years later and have to pay for heartworm treatment because a home did not keep the dog on heartworm prevention. That would take a lot of resources that could be used for saving other dogs from euthanasia. Even worse, we would hate to find out one of our fosters had passed away due to negligence. We love these pets in our own home. We provide the very best Veterinary care and preventative medicine. We expect an adoptive home to do the same.

p We also charge an adoption donation. We cannot save other pets if we cannot pay our medical bills or buy food. We rely on donations to function. We put more money into your future pet than you will pay in an adoption fee 99% of the time. Our adoption fee will depend on how much we have put into the pet medically. We do not even add up the other costs of feeding and housing the pet. Most times, you will be provided with a list of medical treatments and expenses so that you are aware of what they entail. Most adoption fees will be between $75 and $150. That number could be less or more, but it is important to us that the fee not be too extremely high.

p If you have gotten this far, it is fair to assume that you understand our intention with finding great homes for our great pets. If this is not for you, please check with other rescues, as we all have different rules to go by. By all means, if you want a pet right away and don’t want to go through an adoption process, please go to a local shelter and adopt a pet that might not make it out if not for you.
